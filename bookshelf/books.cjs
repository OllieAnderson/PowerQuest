A Prayer for Your Peace of Mind
\n
May calmness settle in the corners of your thoughts.
May your heart be light, and your breath untroubled.
Whatever burdens you carry, may they soften.
Whatever questions haunt you, may they rest awhile.
\n
I wish you the silence that heals,
the quiet that doesn't ache,
and the stillness where nothing is missing.
\n
May you feel safe inside your own being,
untouched by the storm outside.
May you trust that you are enough, just as you are—
and that you are held, even when alone.
\n
Peace to your mind.
Peace to your day.

A Meditation on Digesting Food

Sit or lie down comfortably.
Let your hands rest softly on your belly, over the quiet  of your body.

Take a slow breath in through your nose.
Feel your abdomen rise — not with force, but ease.
Exhale gently. Let go of any tension.

Now turn your awareness inward,
not to thoughts or plans, but to the center of you—
to the warmth of your stomach, that hums below thought.

You have eaten.
You have been given to.
Now your body begins its unseen art.

There is no need to assist, only to trust.
Your body knows what to do.
Muscles contract, enzymes awaken, cells drink in the broken-down gifts.

Let your mind rest in that rhythm.
Let your breath mirror the calm of digestion.
Inhale in.
Exhale out.

If discomfort arises, greet it with kindness.
Softly say, I am here.
I am listening.

You are slowly absorbing and renewing.
What you eat becomes part of you—not just flesh, but mood, memory, motion.

Feel the belly now—heavy, light, silent, active—whatever it is,
welcome it.

As you breathe, imagine warmth moving through your core.
Golden, steady, tender.
Let it flow through your intestines like sunlight through water.

Stay with this quiet for a while.
Let go of urgency, of needing to do.
Just digest.
Just be.

And when you're ready to move again,
do so gently.
Carry with you the knowledge:
Your body is working, always,
in your favor.

A Gentle Bedtime Routine

Dim the Lights (1 hour before bed)
Let your space begin to soften. Turn off overhead lights. Let the brightness of the day fall away.

Unplug (45 minutes before bed)
Set down the phone, the screens, the noise. Let the mind begin to quiet. If it helps, plug your phone in across the room. Let silence enter gently.

Warm Wash or Shower (optional)
Rinse off the day — warm water over skin, steam in the air. Let tension run down the drain. This signals your body: sleep is near.

Change into Sleep Clothes
Loose, soft fabric. Something your body recognizes as comfort. Even this small thing tells you this is nighttime.

Warm Drink (30 minutes before bed)
Herbal tea, or just hot water. Something gentle. Something that doesn’t ask anything of you. Sip slowly. Feel it move through you.

Write or Reflect (20 minutes before bed)
In a notebook or your thoughts—reflect on the day. A moment that was good. A moment that asked something of you. Let the day release its grip. No judgment. Just noticing.

Light Stretch or Bed Yoga
Gentle movements in bed: stretch your arms overhead, roll your shoulders, draw your knees to your chest. A breath in. A breath out. Let the body settle.

Lie Down Intentionally
When you slip beneath the covers, do it with awareness. Feel the sheets. The weight of blankets. The support of the bed beneath you.

Breath Practice or Meditation
Try this: Inhale for 4 counts. Hold for 4. Exhale for 6.

Let Go of the Day
You’ve done enough.

Good night.
